# Train Time Finder For TFW Services 

![beautiful gif of the script working](train.gif)

## What is this?
This is a python script that uses Transport For Wales' API to get train arrival and departure times.

## How do I use this?
`python3 trainTimes.py <origin> <destination> <time> <date>`

## Why did you make this?
Transport For Wales' mobile app takes way too long to load, especially if all I'm doing is checking the time in which one train arrives at the station. This is a lot faster for me.
