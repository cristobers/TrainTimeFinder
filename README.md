## What is this?
This is a python script that uses Transport For Wales' API to get the train arrival and departure times.

- `-h` Displays the help menu
- `-o` Is your origin station (the one you're at)
- `-d` Is your destination station (the one you're going to)

## Why did you make this?
Because I wanted to.
