# Train Time Finder For TFW Services 

## How do I use this?
- `-h` Displays the help menu
- `-o` Is your origin station (the one you're at)
- `-d` Is your destination station (the one you're going to)

## What is this?
This is a python script that uses Transport For Wales' API to get the train arrival and departure times for Transport For Wales' journeys.

## Why did you make this?
I got frustrated with Transport For Wales' mobile interface for finding train times.
